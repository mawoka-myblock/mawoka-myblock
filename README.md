## Howdy! 👋
I am Mawoka and I am not very good at coding (not like ➡🐱‍💻). Why I still try it?
- **I have 🎳(fun)!**
- I ❤ Open source 
## My Skills:
- 🐍 (Python)
- GDScript ([Godot](https://godotengine.org))
- I also run a Minecraft-Server! You can visit it if you want! (Be careful, it is 🇩🇪) But you can still come: [Discord](https://discord.gg/nf4q3jK) or the [Website](https://myblock.de.cool)!
- Email me [mawoka-myblock@e.email](mailto:mawoka-myblock@e.email)!
If you want to mail me, consider to encrypt it with OpenPGP: [4C1D 141D 7B92 5B1C E537 D0EC 111A 6EB8 0FA0 2AAD](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/4C1D141D7B925B1CE537D0EC111A6EB80FA02AAD)
> I don´t know why but I love the word 'Howdy'!
